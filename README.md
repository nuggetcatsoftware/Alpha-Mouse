## Calibration
Hands may not detect properly on first time start. Put both hands in front of your computer and slowly turn both hands until a green frame appears. Note: Prolonged use of the application may reduce accuracy and calibrate when appropiate

## Variables
This mouse uses a threshold variable to control the sensitivity to flickering ratio, which more sensitivity means more flickering, and vise-versa. Keep in mind that this is meant to be tuned by the user and the exe version will be set to laptop default of 6.
